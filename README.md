### Preparing for Postpartum Recovery

#### Vaginal Delivery:
- Perineal care: Use warm sitz baths and apply cooling witch hazel pads.
- Stool softeners and hydration to ease bowel movements.
- Use a peri bottle for gentle cleansing.

#### C-Section:
- Rest is crucial—avoid heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks.
- Use a supportive abdominal binder for comfort.
- Watch for infection signs (redness, warmth, or discharge at the incision).

### Health Concerns During Pregnancy
**Preeclampsia**:
- Symptoms: High blood pressure, swelling in hands/face, protein in urine.
- Prevention: Regular prenatal checkups and staying hydrated.

**Common Fears**:
- *Shoulder Dystocia*: Rare but manageable by healthcare professionals. Be aware, but trust your team.
- *Big Baby*: Discuss options with your doctor; many big babies are delivered without complications.
- *Braxton Hicks*: These "practice contractions" are normal. Stay hydrated and change positions to ease discomfort.

### Supplements
- **Iron**: Helps combat postpartum anemia. Pair with vitamin C for better absorption.
  - Recommendation: *Floradix Iron Supplement* or *Slow FE*.
- **Lactation Herbs**: Moringa, fenugreek, and blessed thistle can support milk production. Always consult your doctor.

## The First Few Weeks with Baby

### What’s Normal for Newborns?
**Sleep**:
- Expect 16-18 hours of sleep daily, but in short bursts of 2-3 hours.
- Baby’s sleep cycle will gradually lengthen after 6-8 weeks.

**Feeding**:
- Breastfed babies eat every 2-3 hours; formula-fed every 3-4 hours.
- Look for hunger cues: rooting, sucking motions, or hands to mouth.

**Diapering**:
- Wet diapers: 6-8 per day by the end of week one.
- Poop: First poops are sticky and black (meconium). By day 5, expect yellow, seedy poop if breastfeeding.

### Feeding Essentials

**What’s Normal for Breastfeeding**:
- Cluster feeding during growth spurts (common at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months).
- Baby should latch onto the areola, not just the nipple.
- It’s normal for your baby to nurse for 10-45 minutes per session.

**Breastfeeding Tip**:
Use a Haakaa on one breast while nursing on the other to collect milk leakage.

**Formula Tips**:
- Prepare bottles fresh; discard unused formula after 1 hour.
- Use boiled, cooled water to mix.

### Pro Tip
Wipe most of the poop using the clean front of the diaper before using wipes. This will save you time and wipes!
